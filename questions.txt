What does the orientation='x/y' on openmc.hexagonalPrism() do? It seems like it's not working.

S alpha beta for UC2??

What is the proper way to define a few geometries and then fill them with materials? Ie. what is
the correct structure for a full-scale openmc run? Do you make your geometries and materials
separate and then import them?
